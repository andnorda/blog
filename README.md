## 🛠 Add content

Make sure you have [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) installed.
* Run `hugo new posts/my-awesome-post/my-awesome-post.md` (or one of the other supported [formats](https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/))
* Edit your content , inspecting it as you go by running the live-reloading server `hugo server -D`. The `-D` parameter tells Hugo to also include drafts, all new content is marked as a draft by default.
* When finished editing, mark the content as ready by setting the `draft` parameter to false in the front matter (the comment-like metadata section at the top).
* Create a pull request in this repository. The content is automatically published when the pull request is merged.
