why

Supply chain attacks are on the [rise](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/understanding-the-increase-in-supply-chain-security-attacks), and several high profile incidents in the recent years have been attributed to breaches in the supply chain. 

Modern applications tend to have complex supply chains. The artifacts we produce are stored, built and tested in a variety of systems run by different vendors, and our code depends on large amounts of third party libraries that we for the most part know nothing about. If attackers can insert themselves in any point of the supply chain it's often trivial to add all the back doors they want without having to bypass the security measures that are present in and around the finished product running in production.
